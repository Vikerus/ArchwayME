ArchwayME
=========

Anyone wishing to contribute to this project is encouraged to contact me with ideas, concerns, or questions.
Many features which can be found in the source are not to be used in a production senario and as such are not representative of the main intent of this program.

In short ArchwayME is a social platform to be used as a service. Being open source and free. I the creator beleive in freedom of information. Together we the users and developers of the web should be able to make a pretty secure social platform upon which to communicate.
