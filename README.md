ArchwayME
=========

Anyone wishing to contribute to this project is encouraged to contact me with ideas, concerns, or questions.
Many features which can be found in the source are not to be used in a production senario and as such are not representative of the main intent of this program.

In short ArchwayME is a social platform to be used as a service. Being open source and free. I the creator believe in freedom of information. Together we the users and developers of the web should be able to make a pretty secure social platform upon which to communicate or develop further on.

Goals
=========

-Security is the top priority.
-Encryption of all data sets.
-Minimization of collected data.
-Simple messaging.
-Simple image uploading.
-Discrete profile page.
-Flexible and secure bulletin board.
-User friendly interface.
-Scalablity in relation to performance.

The Idea and Function
=========
This social platform works a little like a phone book. The idea is to offer a private form of social networking. Other sites do their best to create a platform where you are insentivised to share more and more about yourself in an open way. This is a great way to create a social web of influence but comes at the price of privacy. Where one might find it as a fun way of expression the other side is someone sees it as an easy way to create a profile of who you are with relative ease. The idea is to facilitate communication instead of social advertisment. But for those who do wish to share a bit about who they are a profile can be created and made public or private. A simple blog entry of 1600 characters is allowed to be saved for others you know to read. 


First to make contact with someone you must know their "Handle" a simple pseudo identity which is only known to those who would actually come to know "you." Each user is given a large id called a "FriendCode." This is very similar to the system that 3DS's use but more user friendly as you will be looking people up with a Handle and not a set of numbers. Rather the set of numbers is used to make the storage of messages a tad bit more private if someone would ever retrieve said database. While allowing messages to be queried for by their owner. 
The user profile is stored in the "User" database(to be totally encrypted) seperate from the "messages" database. Each user upon signing up is given a "wallet" to store points, a "friendcode" for communication, a "handle" to identify with, the email is stored to serve as part of the login process, and a 1600 character blog entry as "slate."

Background
=========

My background : I am self taught in php. This means that methods used in the scripts will be rudimentary and possibly redundant. Much of what is in the original source was created as I learned. 

Facebook is simply too intrusive. While it is a great way to "network" it is quickly becoming a horrible place to be "social." It is my hope that this simple and private system for social interation will become wide spread and trustworthy.
